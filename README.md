A simple GNOME Shell extension that automatically sets a random wallpaper from a user-specified local directory every time you boot your system.

## Compatibility

The extension was tested only with GNOME 48 and 49, but it should work without issue from 45 and up.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the extension head to the Official GNOME Extensions website.

Remember to set a folder in the extension settings for it to work.

### Important to know

The wallpaper will change after a 3 second wait after startup. This is to ensure that the desktop environment is done loading.

## Support BootPaper
